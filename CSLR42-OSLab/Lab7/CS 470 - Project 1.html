<h2>Project 1 - Pthread Application</h2>

<p>

</p><h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> The primary purpose of this assignment is to gain experience with multicore
parallelism using the standard POSIX Pthreads library, including exposure to
multithreading concepts such as mutexes and conditions. The secondary purpose
of this assignment is to gain experience implementing a <em>master/worker task
queue</em> model of parallel computation. </p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> You will develop a parallel version of the following serial program:
<code><a href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/lam2mo/cs470_2016_01/files/sum.c">sum.c</a></code> </p>

<p> The program reads a list of "tasks" from a file. Each task consists of a
character code indicating an action and a number. The character code can be
either a "p" (for "process") or "w" (for "wait"). The input file simulates
various workloads entering a multiprocessing system. In a real system, the "p"
actions (the tasks) would likely be calls to computational routines. For our
purposes, "processing" a task with number <em>n</em> just means waiting
<em>n</em> seconds using the <code>sleep</code> function and then updating a few
global aggregate variables (sum, odd count, min, and max). The "w" action
provides a way to simulate a pause in incoming tasks. </p>

<p> For example, the following script simulates one initial one-second task
entering the system, followed by a two-second delay. After the delay, a
two-second task enters the system followed by a three-second task. </p>

<pre>p 1
w 2
p 2
p 3
</pre>

<p> Using a purely serial processing system (as implemented in the provided
<code>sum.c</code>), the above scenario will take eight seconds to finish: </p>

<pre>t=0    t=1    t=2    t=3    t=4    t=5    t=6    t=7    t=8
|      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
---------------------------------------------------------
| p 1  | w 2         | p 2          | p 3               |       serial version
---------------------------------------------------------
</pre>

<p> The final output should match the following (sum, # odd, min, max): </p>

<pre>6 2 1 3
</pre>

<p> In this project you will extend this program to take advantage of a
multicore CPU using a <em>task queue</em> model. In such a model, the main
program spawns a set number of worker threads. <span style="color:red"> You
should read the number of threads from the command line as a new second
parameter. </span> The main program and worker threads communicate using a
<em>task queue</em> to keep track of tasks that still need to be processed. </p>

<p> Observe that if we allowed the first task to be processed during the wait,
we could reduce the time by a single second: </p>

<pre>t=0    t=1    t=2    t=3    t=4    t=5    t=6    t=7
|      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
--------------------------------------------------
| w 2         | idle                             |      master
--------------------------------------------------
| p 1  | idle | p 2         | p 3                |      single worker
--------------------------------------------------
</pre>

<p> This can be achieved by splitting the actual processing work out into a
<em>worker</em> thread that can work parallel to the original <em>master</em>
thread. This allows the master thread to focus on receiving jobs while the
worker thread focuses on doing the actual work. In the above scenario, the first
task arrives at t=0 while the second two tasks arrive simultaneously at t=2.
</p>

<p> Because our tasks are independent, the situation can be further improved by
the addition of more worker threads, assuming we have enough physical CPU cores
to take advantage of them. In the example above, the last two tasks could be
executed simultaneously to save two additional seconds: </p>

<pre>t=0    t=1    t=2    t=3    t=4    t=5
|      |      |      |      |      |
------------------------------------
| w 2         | idle               |    master
------------------------------------
| p 1  | idle | p 2         | idle |    worker 1
------------------------------------
| idle        | p 3                |    worker 2
------------------------------------
</pre>

<p> Your program should work as follows. At the beginning of execution, the
master thread spawns a set number of worker threads (given by a command line
parameter). The worker threads are idle at first. Once the workers have been
fully initialized, the master then begins to handle tasks from the input file by
adding them to a task queue, waking up an idle worker thread (if there are any)
for each task. When a thread is awakened, they begin to pull tasks from the
queue and process them. If the queue ever runs out of tasks, the worker should
block again until awakened by the master. If the master encounters a "w" (wait)
command, it waits the given number of seconds before continuing in the input
file. After all tasks have been added to the queue, the master waits for the
queue to be exhausted, waking idle threads as necessary to help. When the queue
is empty, the master waits for non-idle workers to finish, then sets a global
flag to indicate that the entire program is done, re-awakening all worker
threads so that they can terminate.  The master then cleans everything up and
exits. </p>

<p> To implement the above system, you should use Pthread threads, mutexes, and
conditions as covered in class and in the textbook. Your program should take the
number of worker threads as a second command-line parameter; the performance on
parallelizeable work loads should scale linearly with the number of threads. You
should use at least one mutex (although you will probably need more than one)
and at least one condition. You must also keep an explicit task queue data
structure. </p>

<p> <strong><span style="color:red"> You MAY NOT use semaphores for this
        assignment. </span></strong> While there may be a solution to this
problem using semaphores, one of the main goals of this project is to gain
experience using mutexes and conditions. </p>

<h3> Submission </h3>

<p> You should copy <code>sum.c</code> into a new file called
<code>par_sum.c</code> and modify it to implement the master/worker system
described above. Your modified program should accept TWO command-line parameters
instead of one: 1) the input filename and 2) the number of worker threads. Your
program must compile on POSIX-compliant systems using the following
Makefile: </p>

<pre>default: sum par_sum

sum: sum.c
	gcc -g -O2 --std=c99 -Wall -o sum sum.c

par_sum: par_sum.c
	gcc -g -O2 --std=c99 -Wall -o par_sum par_sum.c -lpthread

clean:
	rm -f sum par_sum
</pre>

<p> You should submit your modified program as <code>par_sum.c</code> on Canvas
by the due date. You should not submit your Makefile or anything else. </p>

<p> All submitted code should be elegant, clean, consistent, and
well-documented. The code I have provided uses 4-space indentation and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS">1TBS</a> style.
If you choose to reformat the file to match your own style preferences, make
sure you apply the changes throughout. </p>

<h3> Peer Reviews </h3>

<p> One of the goals of this course is to encourage good software development
practices, especially when building a parallel or distributed software system.
For this project, you will be assigned two other random students in the course.
You must review their code and offer constructive feedback according to the
given <a href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/lam2mo/cs470_2016_01/files/code_reviews.pdf">rubric</a>. </p>

<p> After the submission deadline, I will assign you two other submissions to
review on Canvas. I expect you to review two distinct submissions that are not
your own; I will do my best to ensure that the assignments work out but
sometimes Canvas does not cooperate. It is your responsibility to inform me
immediately if you have been assigned yourself, your partner, or two other
same-team partners to review. </p>

<p> To complete the peer review, submit a Canvas comment on the submission with
your assessment of the submission according to the <a href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/lam2mo/cs470_2016_01/files/code_reviews.pdf">provided code review guidelines</a>. I expect at
least two paragraphs per review with detailed observations and an assigned
overall numeric score. You will be graded on the quality, thoroughness, and professional
tone of your review. The peer reviews are due one week after the original
project due date. </p>
